This is a Dog Picture finding React.js App

Here is a link to the deployed app on heroku:

[https://calm-sierra-93040.herokuapp.com/](https://calm-sierra-93040.herokuapp.com/)


This app allows you to:  

1. View a list of dog breeds
2. Click on the breed button to view a picture of the dog
3. Click on "New Pic!" to view a different pic, and keep clicking to cycle through more pictures
4. Click to go back to the breeds list

Design choices in this:
- it is designed to load up an initial list of breeds so that there's no delay
- it renders the card holding dog pictures in-place, so that after viewing a dog, users can navigate back without losing their place
- it allows multiple cards to open so that users can compare dog pics accross breeds
- it updates the list of breeds and images etc with fresh data from the api so that you always get the hottest pics of dogs!
    
I used a bit of react router for this, as well as bootstrap for simplifying the UI.



Thanks for checking it out!
